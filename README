Visualisation tool for led cube animations.

The software for the Arduino / Ledcube is Free Software, it may be
distributed under the GPL Licence, either version 2, or (at your
option) a later version of the GPL. See the file COPYING for details.

There is a Qt project file - run `qmake && make` to build.

The program reads animations from the led cube control software,
https://github.com/knielsen/Ledcube, and displays them using OpenGL at the
appropriate framerate. Typical usage:

    g++ -g mk_animation.cc && ./a.out --ledpro --loop  | ledcube-viewer --11

The --11 option displays the 11x11x11 version. There is also the option to
display the 5x5x5 instead.
